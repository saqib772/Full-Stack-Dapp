### 👋 Welcome to our Full Stack Dapp Github Repository! 🚀

This repository contains a full-stack decentralized application (Dapp) built using Solidity, Ether.js, Hardhat, and React JS. The Dapp allows users to send and receive messages securely using blockchain technology.

### 📝 Code Description
The Solidity smart contract in this repository is responsible for managing the message data stored on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract includes a struct called "Info" that holds the message's name, content, timestamp, and sender's address. The contract also includes two functions, "Send_Message" and "Get_Message," which enable users to send and retrieve messages from the blockchain.

### 🛠️ Tools Used

* Solidity: A high-level programming language used to write smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
* Ether.js: A library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
* Hardhat: A development environment to build, test, and deploy smart contracts.
* React JS: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

# 🚀 Getting Started
To run this Dapp on your local machine, follow the instructions below:

* Clone this repository to your local machine.
* Install the necessary dependencies by running the command "npm install" in the root directory.
* Start the local blockchain by running the command "npx hardhat node" in a separate terminal window.
* Deploy the contract to the local blockchain by running the command "npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost" in the root directory.
* Start the frontend by running the command "npm start" in a separate terminal window.




### 🎉 Thank you for visiting our Github Repository! We hope you find our Dapp helpful and informative. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to us.












# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```


# About The Project, Things To Consider Before Making DAPP

* Install hardhat 
* Make The Smart Contract then deploy ```Deploy.js```  using Remix or Using Hardhat 
* Create The React App.
